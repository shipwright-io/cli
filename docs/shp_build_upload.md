## shp build upload

Run a Build with local data

### Synopsis


Creates a new BuildRun instance and instructs the Build Controller to use data from a local directory
to be used for the Build. Two options are supported: streaming and bundling. With these, you can
employ Shipwright Builds from a local repository clone.

When streaming is used, the Build Controller waits for the data being streamed to the build pod,
instead of executing "git clone". The upload skips the ".git" directory completely, and it follows
the ".gitignore" directives, when the file is found at the root of the directory uploaded.

In case a source bundle image is defined, the bundling feature is used, which will bundle the local
source code into a bundle container and upload it to the specified container registry. Instead of
executing using Git in the source step, it will use the container registry to obtain the source code.

	$ shp buildrun upload <build-name>
	$ shp buildrun upload <build-name> /path/to/repository


```
