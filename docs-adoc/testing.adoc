= Testing

All testing tooling is managed by the `Makefile` on this project, therefore all you'll have to do is
invoke one of those targets to test current changes.

== Unit

To execute unit-testing present on this project, run:

[,sh]
----
make test-unit
----

== E2E

End-to-End (E2E) tests aim to mimic the real world usage of this CLI against the
https://github.com/shipwright-io/build[Shipwright Build Controller]. To run end-to-end tests, make sure you have the
latest changes compiled (`make build`), and then run the tests (`make test-e2e`), in short:

[,sh]
----
make build test-e2e
----

=== Requirements

The CLI will interact with https://github.com/shipwright-io/build[Shipwright Build] in the Kubernetes instance. Before running the end-to-end tests make sure https://github.com/shipwright-io/build[Shipwright Build] and its dependencies is installed.

=== GitHub Action

Continuous integration (CI) tests are managed by GitHub Actions, to run these jobs locally please consider https://github.com/shipwright-io/setup/blob/main/README.md#contributing[this documentation section] which describes the dependencies and settings required.

After you're all set, run the following target to execute all jobs:

[,bash]
----
make act
----

The CI jobs will exercise <<unit,unit>> and <<e2e,end-to-end>> tests sequentially, alternatively you may want to run a single suite at the time, that can be achieved using `ARGS` (on `act` target).

Using `ARGS` you can run a single `job` passing flags to https://github.com/nektos/act[act] command-line. For instance, in order to only run <<unit,unit tests>> (`make test-unit`):

[,bash]
----
make act ARGS="--job=test-unit"
----

==== BATS

https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core[BATS] is a testing framework for Bash. It's structured as a regular script with enhanced
syntax to define test cases, collect results, and more.

The BATS core tool and it's supporting libraries are linked in this project as `git submodules`,
alleviating the need to install BATS yourself.

To run BATS based tests, make sure that you have cloned the project (including all submodules):

[,sh]
----
# Option 1: Clone the repository and populate submodules right away
git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/shipwright-io/cli.git

# Option 2: Populate submodules after cloning
cd /your/project/directory/cli
git submodule init
git submodule update
----

then run:

[,sh]
----
make test-e2e
----

=== Test Cases

The usual https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core[BATS] test-cases can be defined as the following example:

[,bash]
----
@test "short test description, or test name" {
	# prepare the test-case context running the necessary commands to do so.
	kubectl ...

	# then execute the actual test, usually by running "shp" command with arguments.
	result=$(shp ...)

	# at the end, assert the test result by inspecting the output, or maybe, execute probes to
	# identify if the desired changes have been performed on the cluster, and such.
	[ ! -z "${result}" ]
}
----

Repetitive tasks can be defined as Bash `function`, the actual `shp` command employed during testing
is overwritten to use executable compiled in the project folder.
